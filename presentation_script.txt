This is our EERD. It can be broken up into three main parts, the users that will be interacting with tthe other parts of the database, the city locations and general locations which are both super classes. Every other entity is eiher a weak entity having an identifying relationship to one of the subclasses or a subclass itself. 

The entities that are subclasses to city locations are HOUSE, STORE, SCHOOL, JOB and COMMUNITY SUPPORT. 

The entities that are subclasses of general locations are province or territory and city.

---------------------


City location  is a generalization of its subclasses with attributes ID, Accessibility rating, Name, Location, Address and link/website.
-------------------


We then have Job, which has attributes Industry, part time/full time, posting Date, Job state (remote/in person), deadline (apllication), Job Description, Employer.

Community support has attributes Organizers and Offering. We were thinking community supports would include both public and private supports. These include donation centers, food banks or sponsorships that individuals are offering themselves such as living accomodations being offered for free.


--------------------


Houses have attributes sq. footage, Rent Cost (both base rent and utilities), Ammenities offered, Type (apartment/house), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms.
-------------------------------



We were thinking of having different types of STORES such as clothing, food, furniture etc. 

For schools we will have the attribute School type which will contain a minimum and maximum grade.
